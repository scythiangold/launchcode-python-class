# LaunchCode Python Class
Intro to Python, object-oriented programming, and Django

You most likely have completed [cs50x](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x). If not, that's cool, as long as you know programming basics (control flow, looping, variables, functions, etc).

This set of exercises will teach you the basics of Python, introducting you to some object-oriented concepts along the way. There are 3 core problem sets:
* [Problem Set 1 - Mario in Python](https://github.com/chrisbay/launchcode-python-class/tree/master/pset1): Python syntax, loops, conditions, output (stdout)
* [Problem Set 2 - Mario with a Pyramid Class](https://github.com/chrisbay/launchcode-python-class/tree/master/pset2): classes and constructors, file I/O
* [Problem Set 3 - Strategy Pattern, etc]: strategy pattern, packages, unit tests

The last problem set relies on completion of the second part of the [LaunchCode Javascript Class](https://github.com/chrisbay/launchcode-javascript-class)

* [Problem Set 4 - Django](https://github.com/chrisbay/launchcode-python-class/tree/master/pset4-django): Django web MVC framework, object-relational mapping
